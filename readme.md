# Narrative Code Project


# Description
I came up with this idea because I wanted opportunities to practice writing functions that used various array methods, as well as CSS animations. Since I'm a writer and an artist, the idea of using JavaScript and CSS to create an aesthetic/narrative experience for the user really interested me. What I also enjoyed was the fact that I'd never built anything like this before, so it forced me to do a lot of reading, research, and problem-solving when I was not sure there was a solution!

The 'lines' of each poem (there are three in use for this project) are written by me, but pulled, individually, based on user-input, to build a completely differet poem.

I will likely continue to re-factor and refine the functions. Even in this first draft I noted my ability to see where I could write leaner code and to adjust accordingly as I went along.

# Goals
- To improve my understanding and skill using various array methods and functions
- A choice-based narrative experience for the user where they 'create' a poem
- Use of CSS animations to make the experience more visually stimulating
- Option to save (email via form) poem and/or 'scramble' the poem upon finishing
