// a collection of phrases, from my work, that the user navigates through...
// and makes choices about where their 'chance poem' will go next, clicking a button...
// the buttons will be words that relate to the line(s) they are capable
// of printing; each button retrieves a new phrase, and triggers another dom event/css animation.

// what kind of functionality will i need? i know i want to pracitce using new/advanced
// array methods and object functionality. perhaps also recursion? in how it knows to
// 'keep going' (like maybe: the poem array they create needs to equal 10 lines), using helper
// function syntax to hold the data outside of the recursive function?

// also: how to load the buttons? because it's all random, there's not 
// a definite, navigable path of action where i can render buttons from. there will also perhaps
// need to be an array of buttons, and an array of corresponding functions that both trigger dom events
// and load lines from poems...

// figure out how to 'save' the poem the user creates and print it to the DOM when they're done, but then it vanishes when they lick "begin again"

// 1 //poemData (maybe start here, without the randomization, this will be easier, but will still let you practice
// CSS animation and more elegant DOM manipulation!)

// i should use those "chance" collages by various Dada artists as inspiration 
// for these little jumbled poems...

// should i make declared objects outside of the array, and then put their variable
// names in an array? idk....
